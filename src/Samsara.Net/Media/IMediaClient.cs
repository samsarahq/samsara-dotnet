    /// This endpoint creates an asynchronous request to upload certain media from a device. The closest available media to the requested timestamp is returned. Images and high-res videos are supported; other types of media (e.g. hyperlapse, low-res) are planned to be supported in the future. Currently, only unblurred media is supported. If a device is offline, the requested media will be uploaded once it comes back online. Quota limits are enforced for media retrievals made through the API. The Create a media retrieval request response includes information about the media retrieval quota remaining for the organization. The media retrieval quota for the organization is reset at the beginning of each month.The quota is expressed using seconds of High Resolution video. 10 still images are equivalent to a 1 second of High Resolution footage.
