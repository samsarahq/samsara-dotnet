    /// This endpoint will return asset locations and speed data that has been collected for your organization based on the time parameters passed in. Results are paginated. If you include an endTime, the endpoint will return data up until that point. If you don’t include an endTime, you can continue to poll the API real-time with the pagination cursor that gets returned on every call. The endpoint will only return data up until the endTime that has been processed by the server at the time of the original request. You will need to request the same [startTime, endTime) range again to receive data for assets processed after the original request time. This endpoint sorts the time-series data by device.
